<h2> ABOUT US </h2>

<p class="About">  

  <br>

  Phone a Clone is a service providing college students with a look-a-like
  to take their place in various events. This comes in handy when college students 
  want to skip class but needs attendance points or participation. It also is useful
  for college students to be in two places at once and many other uses.

<h2> WHO? </h2>

<p class="About">  

  <br>

 While this company was geared towards college students, it 
  can be used for anyone who needs a clone of themselves. The price will 
  increase if you need your look-a-like to perform certain tasks instead of 
  just showing up.
